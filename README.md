# InertialDemoECEF
Inertial navigation demonstration in ECEF-frame.

From software for use with "Principles of GNSS, Inertial, and Multisensor Integrated Navigation Systems," Second Edition. Modified by myself.

Added features:
- Read different types of profiles.
- Plot comparison image use in-profile and out-profile to see the divergence directly.
- Estimated errors and stop the calculating progress when errors become too large.
